My foreshadowed attempt at making an esolang

This takes in a file specified in the program, and interprets it using this interpreter. It is roughly 500 lines of code to interpret and run the program. 

It can handle if statements, while loops, conditional operators and basic variables. It can't do much else other than that for now. 

```py
var1 = 1
var2 = 3
var3 = 2*var1+var2 
if (var3 = 5){
  etch("Order of operations done correctly!")
}
```

Here is the output of the example program
